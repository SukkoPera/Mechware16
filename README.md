## Summary
The firmware was written from scratch for the project, even though it incorporates bits and pieces from other private projects of mine.

It requires the following libraries:
- [Arduino HID Project](https://github.com/NicoHood/HID)
- [LedControl](https://github.com/wayoda/LedControl)

For all documentation, please refer to [MechBoard16](https://github.com/SukkoPera/MechBoard16).

## Releases
If you want to get this board produced, you are recommended to get [the latest release](https://github.com/SukkoPera/Mechware16/releases) rather than the current git version, as the latter might be under development and is not guaranteed to be working.
